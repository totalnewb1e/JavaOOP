## S - Single-responsibility principle
project structured and each class performs its own function. 
## O - Open-closed principle
project uses interfaces as FileOperation ControlOperation, base class code is not changing but opened for modification
## L - Liskov substitution principle
the behavior of the base class is respected in the child class
Example: RepoFile implements Repo.
## I - Interface segregation principle
Used Interfaces are highly specialized
## D - Dependency Inversion Principle
Upper level modules do not depend on lower level modules
